# Mexico State Map

This is an SVG map of Mexico, intended to be included in an iframe. It reads in query var called "state", which is
a three letter Mexican state code. The selected state is animated on the map, and the state's name is shown as a
heading.

This is a barebones, vanilla JS project. It is used to show a map with some knowledge items in our Mexican decks,
highlighting the state on the map.
